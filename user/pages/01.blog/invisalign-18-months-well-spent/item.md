We all have insecurities. I think, as much as it sucks, it’s almost unnatural in life to not have something that makes you self-conscious or uncomfortable about who you are or how you look. For me unfortunately that thing was my face. Yup, my face. After battling with acne for many years and with teeth noticeably crooked, I could never really image looking at my face in the mirror and being happy. I could never image looking at a photo of myself and thinking; ”damn girl, you look
good”. I could never imagine meeting someone for the first time and not being incredibly humiliated to even crack a smile at this new person. Overtime my skin cleared, but my teeth were something that remained a huge burden in my life. 

If you’re reading this and think that I’m being incredibly self-absorbent in caring about my image then I am so jealous that something like this was never an issue for you. After watching all my friends go through the process of braces and becoming confident with the results, I finally decided that I deserved to be happy too.  In September 2016, I booked my consultation with Invisalign. 

Invisalign (clearbraces.ie) is a clear retainer alternative to braces. They’re virtually invisible and practically pain free. In my 18 months with Invisalign I experience 3 days of pain, which is nothing compared to the pain experienced with traditional metal braces. 

Every time I talk about my experience with Invisalign I sound like I’m in a paid ad for the company #spon. I can assure we coughed up the full €3000 for my braces; a price that seems expensive at first, but includes a range of treatments and doesn’t differ much from the price of regular metal braces. My treatment lasted a year and half and honestly flew by. I wore clear retainers for the whole 18 months all day and all night and now wear a mental nighttime retainer. The clear retainers
are only removed to eat, which can take some getting use to but after a few months becomes second nature. My treatment also included a teeth whitening.
Because I could noticeably see the difference in my teeth each month, I became more and more confident as the treatment went on. I use to hate my photo being taken. I cringe at any photo of me prior to Invisalign. I hated how I looked, how I smiled and simply how I tended to hide from the camera; that wasn’t me. 

Eighteen months on and I’m first to the scene whenever there’s a camera (apologies to anyone who has me on snapchat but the filters make my teeth look so good!!). I think self-confidence is one of the most important things in life and something I’ve learned to cherish. How you see yourself will reflect how others see you, and after Invisalign I’ve allowed myself to become generally happier, and I can only hope that has reflected in me as a person. 

So the big question:
Am I happy with my Insvisalign results? 

_I am so, so happy. _

P.S. If you’re ever in Chatham Street Dental Care, tell Kevin I was asking for him.
