Hey friends!

I'm finally getting round to completing the first stage of the EP: demos. 

===

Obviously one of the first things that you need to solidify before going in for demos is your songs. I'm not going to lie, that's something that took me a while. You can write a song in one night and then wake up the next morning and realise it doesn't sound as great as you thought it did at 1am .... madness. Some people can write 4/5 songs in a few weeks that they are happy to record, and some of us aren't so lucky! 

It took me 2 years to finally come together with 4 songs I am happy to record, despite writing countless songs over those 2 years. 

For me, demos are very important when it comes to the production of an EP. I want the sound of a live band on my EP, which is difficult when you're a 19 year solo sing songwriter who plays rhythm guitar on her own. *sigh*

Soon, I will be meeting up with a producer and recording demos, creating bass lines, guitar riffs, drums beats etc. From there, I send these demos onto musicians (guitarists, drummers, bassist), to see if it's a sound their interested in, and hopefully they'll be up for recording an EP with me!

The songs I've chosen are quite sassy. (sorry). BUT! More on that later as I begin to record! 

Until then, check out my new cover of Trap Queen by Fetty Wap!
