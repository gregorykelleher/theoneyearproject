Hello, Megan here!

Welcome to my first blog post of the year!
I'm not going to go into too much of an introduction here in this blogpost - that's what the video down below is for! But I just wanted to say hello and welcome to our lovely little space on the internet.

So, after a stressful couple of weeks, we are FINALLY finished exams. Thank goodness for that! I have found it extremely difficult to concentrate on anything other than the one year project.  It has been literally all I, or Alice have been able to talk or think about.

Our second semester of college doesn't start until February, meaning we've got two entire weeks off to work on our blog/channel. I am SO excited for all of the things coming up in the next two weeks. Our first radio interview, a trip to Paris and plenty of awesome videos in between! EEEEEEKKKKKKK! So much content coming your way! 

For now, I hope you enjoy my video this week - my first 'chatty' style video. I haven't done one of these before and it will definitely take a couple of videos to get totally comfortable in front of the camera, but this is what I've always wanted to do, and I'm really happy with how it turned out! Please be nice, haha!
