Hi everyone! 

So as some of you may know, last week we did something very exciting! We got the opportunity to go on Alice's local radio station, LMFM, just outside of Dublin, to talk about The One Year Project! 

===

Due to being very excited and a bit too pre occupied with vlogging the whole experience, we didn't get very many photos of the day! But I'll attach what we have below!

Such exciting times for us both! We were a bit nervous when the interview began but we think it went really well overall! If you told us this time last year that we would be on the radio talking about blogging and our OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL, I never would have believed you.

And this is only the beginning! 

I have attached a file of the podcast of our interview below. Check it out!

We also vlogged the entire day if you want to check that out too!

Lots more to come from us both in the next couple of days! We filmed a couple of videos together this week which will be going up soon. Alice is going to Belfast for a short trip away and Megan is off to Paris! So stay tuned for some exciting videos and blog posts!
