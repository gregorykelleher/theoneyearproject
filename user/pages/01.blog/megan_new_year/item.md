Hello friends!

May I begin this little blog post by first saying WELCOME TO OUR NEW WEBSITE! Not too shabby, is it? A huge thank you to the creator, Gregory, for such a beautiful new blog!

As my first post on our new website, I wanted to take a look back on the previous year and talk a little bit about what I have learned over the past twelve months, as well as my wishes for 2017. I have made a list of 3 things I have learned in 2016, and 3 things that I hope for in 2017.

###First of all, I learned that YouTube is HARD WORK.

Although I knew that it was a full-time job, I certainly underestimated just how time consuming it is to run a YouTube channel that you aim to be consistently uploading on, especially when you factor in everything else you have to do on a daily basis!

From start to finish of creating a video, it could very easily take 10 hours or more. It is not simply a case of sitting down, chatting for a few minutes, and then uploading it straight to YouTube. Oh no. You have to come up with concepts and ideas. Sometimes you need to write scripts.

Then, depending on the type of video you want to create, the actual filming can take up a huge amount of time… And that’s all before the most difficult and time-consuming part – the editing!

There is nothing I love more than creating a video, but you really need to have the time to put into a video to make it really great, and with juggling all of my other commitments, that was certainly one of the biggest challenges.

###Secondly, I learned that I need to start setting realistic goals.

I am definitely one to overestimate my ability, which results in setting myself unrealistic goals, and then falling flat on my face by failing and not keeping to my word. Setting goals that you can’t possibly stick to does absolutely nothing beneficial, and only makes you feel bad if you don’t succeed.

In 2017, there won’t be an upload schedule. I will upload when I have time, and when I feel inspired. There is absolutely no pressure on me to create content. The only pressure that exists is the pressure that I put on myself.

###And finally, I learned that I can do anything that I put my mind to.

I’m a big fan of the cheesy lines, but it is so true. This year, we have achieved more that I think we could have possibly imagined this time last year, and we did it all by ourselves. I am a huge believer in The Secret and the Law of Attraction.

You can quite literally do anything in the world that you please, if you just begin to focus only on the positive, and put your everything into it. I have made a huge effort over the past year to keep my train of thought as positive as possible. Always keeping my goals in mind, and not tolerating negativity. It sounds pretty airy fairy, I know, until you try it for yourself and realise that it actually works!

2016 was a brilliant year. I also want to mention a few things that I hope for the coming year. I have made a list of New Years Resolutions for 2017, but rather than telling you what they are specifically, I will instead just give you’re a general idea of some of my intentions in 2017.

###First of all, I want to get fitter.

I mean this both physically, by exercising more, but I also really want to begin eating an overall healthier diet. I don’t eat particularly badly, but there is definitely room for improvement. It certainly wouldn’t hurt to see more fruit and veg in my diet! I’m not setting myself any specific results, other than that I want to feel better, healthier and happier with myself overall.

###I want to blog more!

If I could change anything about last year, it would have been to use this blog more often. Video creating is so time consuming that it has been at the unfortunate expense of this blog. In 2017, I want to get back into the swing of things, taking more photos, and just generally sharing my thoughts in a blog post more often.

When I see so many of my friends with their fantastic blogs and photos, it motivates me even more to get back into it. Again, I’m not setting a specific number of blogposts that I will write every month, but rather, a general effort to write and especially photograph more this year!

###Finally, I hope to travel, as much as I possibly can, whenever I can.

I want to see the rest of the world, and there is no better time that the present. I may already have one trip away planned for 2017, and it might involve an Alice, but I want to book even more flights and see as many new countries this year as I possibly can.

Well that’s that! I can’t wait to look back at this blogpost this time next year. Who knows where we will be?

Here’s to a good year.
