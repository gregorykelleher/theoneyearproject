Hello lovely humans!

Guess who's back? 

Yes, yes, I know. The blog has been very Megan deprived the past month, and for that I apologise! I seem to have gotten a little bit distracted the past couple of weeks and because of that I may have neglected the blog just a little bit. However, I am now back and have MUCH to tell you.

I think a little bit of a 'Life Update' blog post is in order. I have quite a lot of things to discuss with you. So, go and grab a cup of tea and let's have a chat.

So the first and most important thing to mention is the fact that myself and Al have finally reached 100 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!!! EEEEEEEEEKKKK!!! Can you feel my excitement through the screen? Honestly though, it may seem like a small number to some, but to us it's huge. TRIPLE DIGITS! The fact that there's 100 people who are interested in what we do and what we have to say genuinely amazes me. So to each and every person who has watched, commented or told a friend about our channel, we appreciate it so very much. In the words of Alice, you're a sound bunch. 

So now that that's out of the way, I also wanted to discuss something that's been on my mind quite a bit lately. I don't know how exactly to explain this without it sounding extremely dramatic or silly, but I will do my best.

The One Year Project is what I would describe as a very amateur form of online documentary. And even though our channel is all about positivity and mental health, I think it's important for both the people who watch us, and for ourselves, to be honest and to document both the ups and downs of our journey as we both work towards our goals.

No need to freak out! There's nothing terribly wrong! However, I do think that the past couple of weeks I have kind of hit a wall in terms of where I see my side of the channel going. 

I watch how each video on the channel performs in terms of views, likes, etc. I'm super interested to find out what people want to see, and what they're not so interested in. From the statistics, it seemed that the Paris vlogs that I had made were the ones attracting the least amount of attention.. which is fine! It just meant that I was excited to try a different approach of vlogging while I went to Denmark to visit my brother.

However, I think that without realising, I ended up putting a lot of pressure on myself throughout our week in Denmark to film a "more interesting" video. Meaning that I ended up more concerned that what I was filming on my camera was more important than actually living in the moment and spending time with the people around me. Every time something interesting popped up, I was shuffling to grab my camera rather than just sitting back and taking it in. 

And this is where I worry it gets a bit confusing. I am definitely not saying that I find vlogging as something tedious or something I don't enjoy. I LOVE it. Nothing makes me happier than being in a beautiful new city with my camera in my hands. What I'm trying to say is, I needed to find my balance. 

So I decided that I would sit out on our balcony in our apartment and try to explain these feelings to my camera (which is quite difficult to do on the spot!). Throughout my rambling to my camera. I think I figured it out. I need to set days where I will film, and then simply, days that I will not. 

To summarise, I never want to associate The One Year Project with stress or negativity. And so finding that balance is important. 

We spent St. Patrick's Day in Copenhagen which was probably the most exciting day of the whole trip (being Irish somewhere abroad on Paddy's Day makes you quite the commodity) and even though I felt a little guilty, I left the camera at home, and decided to just enjoy myself and not worry about "capturing the moment". I had my phone at the end of the day, to film anything that I felt was absolutely necessary!

So, I think that's pretty much everything in my brain for now! I will definitely include this rambley video that I mentioned earlier in some form on the channel. Maybe in the March Recap, maybe even as its own little video! We shall see. 

I hope you enjoyed this random little post, and I will have some great photos and videos from Denmark posted in the next couple of days! 

Thank you for reading my ramblings. 

Much love,

Megan
